# VBA-cool-userform2

'''

This was a project meant to be sold, but it didn't work (I mean, they didn't buy it) :P
It was developed with the help of a friend, he doesn't have a GitHub account, so I'll link its LinkedIn profile: https://bit.ly/2JjPbFU

The entire plan was to create a complex of userforms with the purpose of controlling most of the operations related to a retail company, so basically, there were some people filling spreadsheets like crazy without having some type of order and/or organization and we had to come up with the solution for this mess, we created the first proposal to showcase the extent of the output and the results that they would get. It was a 5 stage project:
  Stage 1: Database design. There were too many criteria for simple categorizations, so we explored our options and the best scenario was to take our data into a relational database, we first deployed the schema in an Excel spreadsheet.
  Stage 2: Data collection. As I mentioned before, there were too many unnecessary things being recorded in a wide variety of spreadsheet, we the proceeded to design and developed a series of 8 userforms with the ability to be scaled for the profiles that were needed (More userforms, More tables in our database).
  Stage 3: Data Transformation. A lot of the daily operations of the users were to be automated and standardized so we could further use the data to gain some insights.
  stage 4: Data Storage: Since everything was designed to be stored in excel spreadsheets until the size of the data was enough to develop a database schema (Remeber we were trying to sell this, so adding costs of database design was not so clever at first). We had to come up with the best way of taking that data into the spreadsheets while also showing the fields in our userforms listboxes. we decided to use arrays in VBA, it is not that much information for this topic on the internet, Believed or not. We were struggling like crazy to show more than 10 columns in those nasty listboxes and this was the only solution, we arranged everything into a single column, but we made it look like it was as many columns as we needed, and even though it was not what we expected it turn out to be a great solution that I'll later introduce in other userforms in my job.
  Stage 5: Data Visualization. Probably the most valuable thing that we were offering was the ability for the employer to constantly audit its employees, we created at first a spreadsheet with the graphs that showed the most important information, but we were going to offer a Business intelligence solution in order to scale this part of the project.
  
In the end, we spent two months developing the whole concept and we got rejected... But the best part? It was fun to do, and we learned a lot in the process. :)
